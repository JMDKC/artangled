Artangled is a bare-bones blog about art shows that lead to connections. It's written by [Joseph Clift](https://josephclift.com).

It is updated weekly, circumstances permitting.

The site is a testament to my main hobby of obsessive gallery-going. I didn't want what I saw to slip away, so resolved to make a record of at least one show I see each week, to remember it by. I also had vague ambitions of cataloguing and recording the artists, galleries and cities of everything I wrote about in some kind of navigable way. Which this site's tags hopefully provide.

It's also a motivation for me to write more (I used to be a journalist, but now work in tech and don't write anything more creative than user stories on a Jira tracker professionally these days).
