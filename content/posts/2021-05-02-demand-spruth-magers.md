I loved *Canopy*, the photograph below, [on show in the main gallery room](https://spruethmagers.com/exhibitions/thomas-demand-london-2021/) at Sprüth Magers at the moment.  It’s a sunny scene of some powdery blue apartment block, with a single, lemon sorbet-coloured titular canopy over-extended over one of the blocky white balconies. All the interiors are in shadow. Given the work’s from 2020, the artist must have been thinking of our lockdown, the confinement of millions to the interior of their homes; for some, their balconies was the only outside space they dared to enjoy.

The arresting strangeness of Demand’s work is that he assembles accurate models of everyday scenes and photographs *those*. It’s not an actual apartment block then, it’s an imagined one. This c-print photo, along with the others in this exhibition, is layered behind thick and reflective glass, almost discouraging the close attention required of the viewer to reveal the artificiality of it all.

*Canopy (2020)*

Taken as a whole, the works in this show pay homage to their own ingenuity and craft. There are scenes of a pink-hued plant nursery (the paper watering cans are adorable) and a lily pond, both tricking the viewer in the same way. There isn’t a sign of human life in any of them.

The willingness of the viewer to be fooled by these scenes, convincing at first glance, uncannily unreal at second glance. Luigi Ghirri did the same a few decades ago with his obsessive documenting of a fairground, where a photo of some mountains suddenly shifted, on close attention, to a photo of a mountain background to some ride.

Demand’s coyly drawing our attention to the own obsessive craft required to construct these unreal scenes, a link that becomes clearer with the newer work upstairs, scenes from the atelier of the great fashion designer Azzedine Alaïa. Tissues marked with a careless but expert hand abut fat orange squares of cardboard. A mannequin stands at an angle, cross-hatched with sure pencil marks. Everywhere in these shots is the strong guiding intelligence of the master designer.

These works are as spooky as that over-extended lemon-coloured canopy, though, as Alaïa died in 2017. It’s another haunted space, organised and recreated under Demand’s exacting eye.
